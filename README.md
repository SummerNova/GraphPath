This is C++ code for finding the shortest path in a bidirectional node graph. 

it is capable of reading the graph data from a txt file that is designated by the user in runtime (as an example, use "input.txt" for reference, but it is possible to use other txt files)

the formatting of the txt file should in a CSV format and should be formatted as follows be as follows: 

Node,NodeName1\n
Node,NodeName2\n
.\n
.\n
.\n
.\n
Node,funnyname46\n
#Edges\n
Edge,Node1,Node2,Length\n
Edge,Node3,Node2,Length\n
.\n
.\n
.\n
.\n
Edge,NodeName1,NodefunnyName46,Length\n

you will be requested the origin node and the destination and then the graph will be scanned to find the route.
